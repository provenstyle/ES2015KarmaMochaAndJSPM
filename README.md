#ES2015KarmaMochaAndJSPM

It turns out that getting a project set up to use 

- ES2015 
- Babel 
- Karma 
- Mocha
- Chai
- and JSPM 

can be pretty challenging.  This set up works.  (Atleast it does today.)

##To run the tests

First install the node modules

	npm install

Then start Karma
	
	karma start

You should see 3 passing tests
